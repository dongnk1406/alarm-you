# Currently, macOS 12.5.1 is shipped with Ruby 2.6.8, which is not what is required by React Native.
# You should use a Ruby version manager like rbenv or RVM to install
# and use ruby version '2.7.6' before pod install.
# See more at https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup#ruby
# Choose Development OS: macOS, Target OS: iOS

npx pod-install
```

4. Start Metro Bundler

```bash
yarn start
```

5. Open new terminals, build for iOS/Android

```bash
